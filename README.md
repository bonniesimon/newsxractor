# newsxractor
Well the LS (Life Skill) teacher of ours wants us to write news report as an assignment. 
I know, I know, that sounds lame. And no I'm not in kindergarden. Stupid KTU!! ðŸ˜£
So I'm making this so that daily a few news articles are saved and I can just copy em later instead of searching for articles of the past month a day before the submission day.
